The last light of autumn filtered through the ancient oak's golden leaves as Lyralei pressed her ear against its massive trunk. The heartwood whispered secrets only the forest-born could understand, and today its message sent chills down her spine.

"The shadow spreads from the north," she murmured, her silver eyes reflecting the dying light. "Three days, maybe four, before it reaches the sacred grove."

For centuries, her people had been the guardians of Elderwood, tending to the delicate balance between the magical realm and the mortal world. But something had gone terribly wrong in the Shadowlands beyond the mountains. The very essence of life was being drained from the northern forests, leaving behind twisted, blackened husks where mighty trees once stood.

Lyralei's grandmother had warned her of such things in the old stories—of the Void Seekers who fed on magical energy until nothing remained but ash and despair. Most elves dismissed these as mere folklore, but Lyralei had always paid attention to the wisdom carried in ancient tales.

She gathered her traveling pack, securing her moonsilver bow and a quiver of arrows carved from living wood. If the Council of Elders wouldn't listen to her warnings, she would have to act alone. The journey to the Crystal Falls would take two days of hard travel, but there, in the hidden depths of the mountain, lay the Wellspring—the source of all magic in their realm.

As she set off through the twilight forest, fireflies began their nightly dance, their gentle glow a stark contrast to the creeping darkness she knew was coming. Each step took her further from everything familiar, but closer to the only hope of saving her homeland.

The fate of Elderwood now rested in the hands of one young elf who dared to believe that sometimes the oldest magic was found not in grand spells, but in the courage to stand against the dark when all others had turned away.
